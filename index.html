                <div class="text">Cosmology is the study of the cosmos, and in its broadest sense covers a variety of very different approaches: scientific, religious and philosophical. All cosmologies have in common an attempt to understand the implicit order within the whole of being. In this way, most religions and philosophical systems have a cosmology.</div>

                    <div class="text">In 16th century Poland, astronomer <strong>Nicolaus Copernicus</strong> (1473-1543) proposed a model of the solar system that involved the Earth revolving around the sun. His ideas took almost a hundred years to gain credence, but Galileo's 1632 assertions that the Earth orbited the sun built upon the Polish astronomer's work, cementing the Copernican revolution.</div>

                    <div class="text">Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, <strong>Johannes Kepler</strong> (1571-1630) determined that planets traveled around the sun not in circles, as Copernicus had thought, but in ellipses. In so doing, he calculated three laws involving the motions of planets that astronomers still use in calculations today</div>

                    <div class="text">Though a model of the Earth circling the sun was first proposed by Copernicus, it took some time before it became widely accepted. <strong>Galileo</strong> is most widely known for defending the idea several years after Kepler had already calculated the path of planets, and Galileo wound up under house arrest at the end of his lifetime because of it.</div>

Building on the work of those who had gone before him — he is quoted as saying, "If I have seen further, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants" — he calculated three laws describing the motion of forces between objects, known today as Newton's laws.</div>

                Books permit us to voyage through time, to tap the wisdom of our ancestors. The library connects us with the insight and knowledge, painfully extracted from Nature, of the greatest minds that ever were, with the best teachers, drawn from the entire planet and from all our history, to instruct us without tiring, and to inspire us to make our own contribution to the collective knowledge of the human species. I think the health of our civilization, the depth of our awareness about the underpinnings of our culture and our concern for the future can all be tested by how well we support our libraries            </div>
